# Parse the Body of a Request Phase 1 - Creating the Server

In this phase, you will create a server and listen for requests on a specified
port.

Create a server using `http`. Allow the server to listen for requests on
port 5000. Log the message "Successfully started the server on port 5000" after
the server starts.

Reference the readings for help if you get stuck.
